# mytoyc

Toy programming language for the compiler construction course. Original code is taken from the tutorial by L. Segal at http://gnuu.org/2009/09/18/writing-your-own-toy-compiler. Original code at github: https://github.com/lsegal/my_toy_compiler.


Following Test cases to be run: 


Test1.txt: In this test, an extern function is made of data type 'void'. printv is a new function created in native.cpp.

Test2.txt: In this test, for the program to run, it must end with a 'Return' statement.

Test3.txt: In this test, an internal function is made of data type 'void'. The return statement should be empty as void function cannot return any expression.

Test4.txt: This is a negative test, Internal function is made of data type 'void' and also returning an expression, therefore, it will show an error.

Test5.txt: This is a negative test, every function should have a return statement, otherwise it will give an error just like in this test case.

Test6.txt: Return statement is placed in the middle of the code block, It will terminate at this point.
